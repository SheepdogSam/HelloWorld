I am loving the new Hak5 Release of the BASH Bunny right now... New to github, however, looks simple enough to git. 
I have the Rubber Ducky and to know the Scripts can migrate to the BASH Bunny is awesome!
THe BASH Bunny is so versatile of a tool it brings so many possibilities to bear!!
THe Duck its still a favorite tool of mine and will remain in the arsenal, but...
I feel like I've Follwed Alice down the Rabbit Hole into a cool new dimension of cyberspace and PWN!!

# Projects:
The Rabbit Hole
The Duck Pond
# Goal:
-To create a versatile library for those 2 awesome tools!-
